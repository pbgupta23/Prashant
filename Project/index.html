        <h1> Doesn't matter how you did it </h1>
        <p> Don't spend too much time fussing over your solution to a problem. If it works, you did it right. </p>

        <p> It doesn't really matter how you made your solution work. What matters is that it does work. In time you will learn to identify smarter or faster solutions. Or how to follow best-practice for your language or framework.</p>

        <h1> Build a portfolio </h1>
<p> Yesterday is a great time to get started building your portfolio. A good portfolio should show your skills.
Don't have any real-life cases to display? Don't worry; make some up:

Finish that pet project of yours and put it in the portfolio.
Display a few of your tutorial apps (but not too many).
Call up a local sports club and ask if they need some free web-work done.
Offer free SEO or accessibility audits to some local non-profit organisations.
    Now, I know it's a bit of a slippery slope to offer your work for free. I am not suggesting you should "trade hours for exposure". But these few free jobs can get your portfolio up and running. You will earn some real-world experience which can give you real leads.

        <h1> Know your motivation </h1>
        <p> It doesn't matter why you are a web developer. It pays your rent or it is your life's passion to make awesome web apps, build and be creative. Whatever your motivation is, don't lose sight of it. </p>
